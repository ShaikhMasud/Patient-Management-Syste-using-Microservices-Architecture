# ðŸ©º Patient Management System (Microservices)

A fully Dockerized microservices system built with Spring Boot, gRPC/protobuf, Kafka, and PostgreSQLâ€”featuring modular architecture, REST and RPC endpoints, synchronous and asynchronous inter-service communication, and scalable event-driven design.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Youâ€™ve built a production-style microservice ecosystem with three core services:

- **Patient Service** â€“ handles patient data  
- **Billing Service** â€“ performs billing logic  
- **Analytics Service** â€“ consumes patient events for analysis  

Everything is packaged with Docker and orchestrated using Docker Compose. Communication happens both via gRPC (Patient â†” Billing) and Kafka (Patient â†’ Analytics), following industry best practices.

## ðŸ›  Infrastructure & Docker Setup

Docker Compose orchestrates:

- PostgreSQL container for persistence  
- Kafka brokers  
- Each microservice runs in its own Docker container built via respective Dockerfile  
- Services share a custom Docker network for seamless internal communication  
- Configurations (ports, topic names, DB credentials) are managed via `.env` or `application.yml`

## Service-by-Service Breakdown

### âœ… Patient Service

- Exposes REST endpoints such as `POST /patients`, `GET /patients/{id}`  
- Publishes events to a Kafka topic (e.g., `patient-events`) on creation/update  
- Sends billing requests via gRPC to the Billing Service  
- Features layered structure: `Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ DTOs`  
- Shares the `patient.proto` for generating Java stubs used in Billing Service

### âœ… Billing Service

- Hosts gRPC RPC endpoints to process billing requests (defined in `patient.proto`)  
- Invoked synchronously by Patient Service for billing generation  
- Encapsulates billing logic with DTOs, services, and persistence via its own database

### âœ… Analytics Service

- Subscribed to Kafka topics via configured Kafka Consumer  
- Consumes messages from the Patient Service producer  
- Stateless listener service designed to facilitate analytics dashboards or logs later  
- Handles serialization/deserialization and error logging in the consumer layer

## ðŸ”„ Communication Mechanisms

### gRPC (Protocol Buffers)

- Defined in `*.proto` file  
- Compiled using Maven or Gradle to generate Java classes  
- Billing Service implements the `ServiceGrpc` interface  
- Patient Service uses gRPC client to invoke billing actions

### Kafka (Event Streaming)

- Patient Service acts as producer, sends serialized patient events  
- Kafka topic (like `patient-topic`) configured in `application.yml`  
- Analytics Service registers `@KafkaListener` to process incoming events  
- Supports scalability via consumer group configuration (e.g., `groupId`)

## ðŸŒŸ Key Learning Outcomes

- End-to-end Dockerization of microservices + infrastructure  
- Modular code structure using DTOs and layered architecture for maintainability  
- Synchronous communication via gRPC (protobuf-defined)  
- Asynchronous, decoupled messaging via Kafka producer/consumer  
- Experience configuring and orchestrating PostgreSQL, Kafka, Zookeeper, and Docker Compose
